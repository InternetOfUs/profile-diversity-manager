to start the development environment.
On this environment you have access to the commands:

 - **start-reload.sh** start a development server that detect the changes
  on the files and start again.
 - **start.sh** start a server similar to the production one. This server
  Not detect the changes, so to be effective you must stop and start again.
 
In both casses you can interact with the stertaed server
at **http://localhost/doc** or at **http://localhost/redoc**.
Also you can stop the server with keys combinations **Control-C**.

If you go to the **tests** directory and execute the command `pytest --cov=../app`
to run all test and obtain a coverage measure of them.

If you not **exit** from the development environment, may be the next time

the next commands:

```
docker stop profile_diversity_manager_dev
docker rm profile_diversity_manager_dev
```
